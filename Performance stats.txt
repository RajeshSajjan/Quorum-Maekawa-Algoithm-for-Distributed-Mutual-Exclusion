Performance:
Based on the stats of 4 runs under different configuration. As the wait time between each run increases and critical section execution time remains same then performance wise it will take more time to complete one successful run as for each round more time is spent in waiting for its turn to execute. The impact on latency will be subsequently less. When execution time in critical section is doubled i.e in this case 6 units of time then there will be more processes waiting for their turn to enter critical section which will in turn increase the latency. Hence increase in critical section execution time will lead to subsequent increase in latency among processes. At the first look latency may look random among all the processes for each of the 20 runs, but average latency of 20 runs will lead to better understanding.
I haven't encountered any deadlocks during the trial runs.
